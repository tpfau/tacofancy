* 1 cup white vinegar or unseasoned rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 tablespoons kosher salt
* 4 bay leaves
* 5 lightly crushed peeled garlic cloves
* 1 bunch of cilantro stems, finely chopped (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 peeled medium carrot, sliced into 1/4 inch slices
* 3 fresh hot chilis (jalepenos, aji amarillo, or peppers of your choice), sliced into 1/4 inch slices
* 10 radishes sliced into quarters
* 1/2 a red onion, sliced into 1/4 inch slices

1. Bring water, vinegar, sugar, salt, bay leaves, garlic, optional cilantro stems, and oregano to a simmer in a small saucepan until salt and sugar are dissolved.
2. Add vegetables and simmer 1 minute.
3. Cover pan and let sit on stovetop for 15 minutes.
4. Transfer to container, cover with brine, and store in the fridge. Keeps a monthish? They never last that long.

Lots of other vegetables could work here: green beans, chopped celery, daikon radish, whatever!
