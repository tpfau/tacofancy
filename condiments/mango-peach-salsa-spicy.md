Spicy Mango Salsa
===================

Do you enjoy the sweetness of mangos and peaches, the refreshing flavor of lime and the hit of jalapeno? Look no further. I mixed and matched the best parts from [All Recipes](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/15059/spicy-mango-salsa/) and [Little Chef Big Appetite](http://littlechefbigappetite.com/best-spicy-mango-salsa-recipe/) to give you a delicious concoction.

## Ingredients

You will need:
* 2 cups diced fresh mango
* 1 cup fresh chopped peaches
* 1/2 cup red bell pepper, diced
* 1/8 cup red onion, minced
* 1 teaspoon jalapeno, minced
* 1/4 cup lime juice
* 1/4 cup chopped basil or cilantro
* 1 teaspoon freshly chopped pickled ginger (optional)


## Directions

1. Mix together mangoes, peaches, basil/cilantro and ginger (if you use it).
2. Add the jalapenos and lime juice to your liking. Add more hit at your own risk.
3. Allow to chill for 2 hours (very optional. I mean, who are we kidding?).
