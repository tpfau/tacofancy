Caramelized red onions
==================

* 3 medium red onions, trimmed and sliced into 1/4 inch slices
* 1 tablespoon salted butter
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* Juice of 2-3 limes (about 1/4 cup)
* Koser salt, to taste

1. Melt butter with oil over low heat.
2. Add onions, and stir to combine.
3. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 50 minutes, until darkly caramelized. If they are sticking too much or starting to burn, add a splash of water to the pan and stir.
4. Deglaze with lime juice, add salt to taste.
